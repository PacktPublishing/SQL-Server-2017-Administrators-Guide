## About the Book
Take advantage of the real power of SQL Server 2017 with all its new features, in addition to covering core database administration tasks. This book will give you a competitive advantage by helping you quickly learn how to design, manage, and secure your database solution.

You will learn how to set up your SQL Server and configure new (and existing) environments for optimal use. After covering the designing aspect, the book delves into performance-tuning aspects by teaching you how to effectively use indexes. The book will also teach you about certain choices that need to be made about backups and how to implement a rock-solid security policy and keep your environment healthy. Finally, you will learn about the techniques you should use when things go wrong, and other important topics - such as migration, upgrading, and consolidation - are covered in detail. Integration with Azure is also covered in depth.

## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
DBCC CHECKDB(<database_name>, REPAIR_ALLOW_DATA_LOSS)
```

To be able to learn hands-on while reading this book, the reader needs at least SQL Server 2017 Evaluation Edition and also a client toolset called SQL Server Management Studio. Both programs are provided by Microsoft for free.
If you want to do experiments with Azure, an Azure subscription will be needed as well. It can be done for free at https://azure. microsoft. com/en-us/.
